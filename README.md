I am yet to do the front end and some part of the back end

motivation
The inspiration behind Study Room stems from my own experiences as a learner. 
Navigating the vast sea of online information can be dounting , and the idea of having a dedicated tutor to guide me through the learning process resonated deeply. This project is my attempt to provide a solution to a problem I faced  first hand
